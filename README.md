#Last.fm Duration Charts

## About

### Last.fm

[Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/) is a website that, among other features, records information about the music you listen to. It is commonly linked with streaming services such as Spotify so that you can see your play counts and other details of your listening statistics. The primary unit of listening that Last.fm works with is the *scrobble*, which means a track has been played one time. The website allows you to view your most scrobbled artists, albums, and tracks. However, scrobbles are length-agnostic: it doesn't matter how short or long a track is, it counts as one scrobble either way. This can lead to potentially misleading charts.

### Duration Charts

This website aims to display your listening habits in a more accurate way, based on the amount of time spent listening to each item. I will use Last.fm's API to get all the data about the users and the tracks. I will try to keep to the formatting and layout of Last.fm, both for practice with CSS as well as for maintaining the user experience of the original website.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
